# rangeless::fn
## `range`-free LINQ-like library of higher-order functions for manipulation of containers and lazy input-sequences.

- Reduce the amount of mutable state.
- Flatten control-flow.
- Lessen the need to deal with iterators directly.
- Make the code more expressive and composeable.

This library is intended for moderate to advanced-level c++ programmers that like the idea of c++ `ranges`, but can't use them for various reasons (high complexity, compilation overhead, debug-build performance, size of the library, etc).


### Simple examples
```cpp
namespace fn = rangeless::fn;
using fn::operators::operator%;   // arg % f % g % h; // h(g(f(std::forward<Arg>(arg))));
using fn::operators::operator%=;  // arg %= fn;       // arg = fn(std::move(arg));

employees %= fn::sort_by([](const auto& e){ return std::tie(e.last_name, e.first_name); });
             // this returns a unary function xs->xs that sorts by the given predicate.

employees %= fn::where([](const auto& e){ return e.last_name != "Doe"; });
             // say Good Riddance to the erase-remove idiom and iterate-erase loops.

employees %= fn::take_top_n_by(10, [](const auto& e){ return e.years_onboard; });

// or 

employees = std::move(employees)
          % fn::sort_by(           [](const auto& e){ return std::tie(e.last_name, e.first_name); })
          % fn::where(             [](const auto& e){ return e.last_name != "Doe"; })
          % fn::take_top_n_by(10,  [](const auto& e){ return e.years_onboard; });
```

```cpp
    // 
    // Top-5 most frequent words among the words of the same length.
    //

    auto my_isalnum = [](const int ch)
    {    
        return std::isalnum(ch) || ch == '_'; 
    };   

    using counts_t = std::map<std::string, size_t>;

    fn::from(
        std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(istr.rdbuf()),
        std::istreambuf_iterator<char>{})

      % fn::transform([](const char c) // tolower
        {    
            return ('A' <= c && c <= 'Z') ? char(c - ('Z' - 'z')) : c; 
        })   

      % fn::group_adjacent_by(my_isalnum)

#if 0
        // build word->count map
      % fn::foldl_d([&](counts_t out, const std::string& in)
        {
            if(my_isalnum(in.front())) {
                ++out[ in ];
            }
            return std::move(out);
        })
#else
        // alternatively:
      % fn::where([&](const std::string& s)
        {
            return my_isalnum(s.front());
        })
      % fn::counts() // map:word->count
#endif

      % fn::group_all_by([](const counts_t::value_type kv)
        {
            return kv.first.size(); // by word-size
        })

      % fn::transform(
              fn::take_top_n_by(5UL, fn::by::second{}))

      % fn::concat()

      % fn::for_each([](const counts_t::value_type& kv)
        {    
            std::cerr << kv.first << "\t" << kv.second << "\n";
        })   
      ;    

    // compilation time:
    // >>time g++ -I ../include/ -std=c++14 -o test.o -c test.cpp
    // real   0m1.176s
    // user   0m1.051s
    // sys    0m0.097s

This is not a range library, like `range-v3`, as it is centered around value-semantics rather than reference-semantics. This library does not know or deal with the multitude of range concepts; rather, it deals with data transformations via higher-order functions. It differentiates between two types of inputs: a `Container` and a lazy `seq<NullaryInvokable>` satisfying single-pass forward-only `InputRange` semantics (also known as a data-stream). Most of the function-objects in this library have two overloads of `operator()` respectively. Rather than composing views over ranges as with `range-v3`, `operator()`s take inputs by value, operate on it eagerly or compose a lazy `seq`, as appropriate (following the Principle of least astonishment), and return the result by value (with move-semantics) to the next stage.

E.g.
- `fn::where`
  - given a container, passed by rvalue, returns the same container filtered to elements satisfying the predicate.
  - given a container, passed by lvalue-reference, returns a copy of the container with elements satisfying the predicate.
  - given a `seq`, passed by value, composes and returns a `seq` that will skip the elements not satisfying the predicate.
- `fn::sort`
  - given a container, passed by value, returns the sorted container.
  - given a `seq`, passed by value, moves elements into a `std::vector`, and delegates to the above.
- `fn::transform`
  - given a `seq`, passed by value, returns a `seq` wrapping a composition of the transform-function over the underlying `NullaryInvokable`.
  - given a container, passed by value, wraps it as `seq` and delegates to the above.


Some functions in this library internally buffer elements, as appropriate, with single-pass streaming inputs, whereas `range-v3`, on the other hand, imposes multipass ForwardRange or stronger requirement on the inputs in situations that would otherwise require buffering. This makes this library conceptually more similar to UNIX pipelines than to c++ ranges.

| Operations | Buffering behavior | Laziness |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| `fn::group_adjacent_by`, `fn::in_groups_of` | buffer elements of the incoming group | lazy |
| `fn::unique_all_by` | buffer unique keys of elements seen so far | lazy |
| `fn::drop_last`, `fn::sliding_window` | buffer a queue of last `n` elements | lazy |
| `fn::transform_in_parallel` | buffer a queue of `n` executing async-tasks | lazy |
| `fn::group_all_by`, `fn::sort_by`, `fn::lazy_sort_by`, `fn::reverse`, `fn::to_vector` | buffer all elements | eager |
| `fn::take_last` | buffer a queue of last `n` elements | eager |
| `fn::where_max_by`, `fn::where_min_by` | buffer maximal/minimal elements as seen so-far | eager |
| `fn::take_top_n_by` | buffer top `n` elements as seen so-far | eager |


### Signaling `end-of-sequence` from a generator-function

More often than not a generator-function that yields a sequence of values will not be an infinite Fibonacci sequence, but rather some bounded sequence of objects, either from a file, a socket, a database query, etc, so we need to be able to signal end-of-sequence. One way to do it is to yield elements wrapped in `std::unique_ptr` or `std::optional`:
```cpp
  fn::seq([]() -> std::unique_ptr<...> { ... })
% fn::take_while([](const auto& x) { return bool(x); })
% fn::transform(fn::get::dereferenced{})
% ...
```
If your value-type has an "empty" state interpretable as end-of-inputs, you can use the value-type directly without wrapping.

If you don't care about incurring an exception-handling overhead once per whole seq, there's a simpler way of doing it: just return `fn::end_seq()` from the generator function (e.g. see my_intersperse example). This throws end-of-sequence exception that is caught under the hood (python-style). If you are in `-fno-exceptions` land, then this method is not for you.


### Summary of different ways of passing inputs

```cpp
      fn::seq([]{ ... }) % ... // as input-range from a nullary invokable

          std::move(vec) % ... // pass a container by-move
                    vec  % ... // pass by-copy

           fn::from(vec) % ... // as move-view yielding elements by-move (std::move will make copies iff vec is const)
          fn::cfrom(vec) % ... // as above, except always take as const-reference / yield by copy
           fn::refs(vec) % ... // as seq taking vec by reference and yielding reference-wrappers

fn::from(it_beg, it_end) % ... // as a move-view into range (std::move will make copies iff const_iterator)
  fn::from(beg_end_pair) % ... // as above, as std::pair of iterators
```
Note: `fn::from` can also be used to adapt an lvalue-reference to an `Iterable` that implements
`begin()` and `end()` as free-functions rather than methods.

### `#include` and compilation-time overhead

Despite packing a lot of functionality, `#include <fn.hpp>` adds only a tiny sliver (~0.03s) of compilation-time overhead in addition to the few common standard library include-s that it relies upon:

"In God we trust, all others bring data":
```cpp
// tmp.cpp

#if defined(STD_INCLUDES)
#   include <stdexcept>
#   include <algorithm>
#   include <functional>
#   include <vector>
#   include <map>
#   include <deque>
#   include <string>
#   include <cassert>
#elif defined(INCLUDE_FN)
#    include "fn.hpp"
#elif defined(INCLUDE_RANGE_ALL)
#    include <range/v3/all.hpp>
#endif

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
# just std-includes used by fn.hpp
>>time for i in {1..10}; do g++ -std=c++14 -DSTD_INCLUDES=1 -o tmp.o -c tmp.cpp; done
real    0m3.682s
user    0m3.106s
sys     0m0.499s

# fn.hpp
>>time for i in {1..10}; do g++ -std=c++14 -DINCLUDE_FN=1 -o tmp.o -c tmp.cpp; done
real    0m3.887s
user    0m3.268s
sys     0m0.546s

# range/v3/all.hpp, for comparison
>>time for i in {1..10}; do g++ -std=c++14 -DINCLUDE_RANGE_ALL=1 -I. -o tmp.o -c tmp.cpp; done
real    0m22.687s
user    0m20.412s
sys     0m2.043s
```

There are not many compiler-torturing metaprogramming techniques used by the library, so the template-instantiation overhead is reasonable as well (see the Top-5 most frequent word example; leaving it as an excercise to the reader to compare with raw-STL-based implementation).


### Discussion
There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the intended use-cases for this style of coding.

Many programmers after getting introduced to toy examples get an impression that
the intended usage is "to express the intent" or "better syntax" or to "separate the concerns", etc.  
Others look at the toy examples and point out that they could be straightforwardly written
as normal imperative code, and I tend to agree with them:
Never write a code like:
```cpp
    std::move(xs)
  % fn::where(     [](const auto& x) { return x % 2 == 0; })
  % fn::transform( [](const auto& x) { return x * x; }
  % fn::for_each(  [](const auto& x) { std::cout << x << "\n"; })
```

, if it can be written simply as
```cpp
for(const auto& x : xs)
    if(x % 2 == 0)
        std::cerr << x*x << "\n";
```
If you are doing "functional style" for no good reason, you are doing it wrong - there's no value-added
and you are paiyng compile-time, debugging-layers, and possibly run-time overhead.

There are some scenarios where functional-style is useful:

#### Const-correctness.
By this I mean: when an lvalue is in the process of being built, it should be considered write only;
when it is is being used, it should be read-only (declared const and enforced by the compiler, unless
the intent is to `std::move` it).
e.g. a contrived example
```cpp
map<std::string, size_t> word_counts{};

// modify the map of word-counts...
// ...
// ... many of code-lines later, that may or may not have modified word_counts...
// ...
// access word_counts

```
If `word_counts` could be declared const, you could ignore all the code
that may-or-may-not modify word_counts between declaration and usage, e.g.:
```cpp
const auto word_counts = words % fn::fold_d([](map<std::string, size_t> m, const auto& word)
{
    ++m[word];
    return std::move(m);
};
```

Another code-pattern for this is immediately-executed-lambda.
```cpp
const X x = [&]
{
    X x{}; // this shadows the outside-x above, and it's GOOD, 
           // as we don't want to accidently access it here.

    // build X...
    return x;
}();
```

#### Reduction of mutable state.
Non-composeable API force the programmer to declare mutable state that really should be temporary.
e.g.
```cpp
auto values = get_values(); // has to be non-const, because will sort
std::sort(values.begin(), values.end());
```
whereas a composeable API does not necessitate a mutation of an lvalue:
```cpp
const auto sorted_values = get_values() % fn::sort();
```

#### Erase-remove idiom.
If you feel that the idiomatic way of filtering a container is an abomination that should have never seen the light of day, then you'll find this library useful for that alone.

#### Transformations over infinite (arbitrarily large) streams (`InputRange`s)

The most useful use-case is the scenarios for writing a function or an expression
where the input is an infinite stream that you want to manipulate lazily, like a UNIX pipeline, e.g. the above-mentioned [aln_filter.cpp](test/aln_filter.cpp).


### Downsides and Caveats.
Compilation errors related to templates are completely gnarly.
For this reason the library has many `static_asserts` to help you figure things out. If you encounter a compilation error that could benefit from adding a `static_assert`, please open an issue.


Sometimes it may be difficult to reason about the complexity space and time requirements of some operations. There are two ways to approach this: 1) Peek into documentation where I discuss space and time big-O for cases that are not obvious (e.g. how `lazy_sort_by` differs from regular `sort_by`, or how `unique_all_by` operates in single-pass for `seq`s). 2) Feel free to peek under the hood of the library. Most of the code is intermediate-level c++ that should be within the ability to grasp by someone familiar with STL and `<algorithm>`.


There's a possibility that a user may instantiate a `seq` and then forget to actually iterate over it, e.g.
```cpp
    std::move(inputs) % fn::transform(...); // creates and immediately destroys a lazy-seq.

    // whereas the user code probably intended:
    std::move(inputs) % fn::transform(...) % fn::for_each(...);
```
